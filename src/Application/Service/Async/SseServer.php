     * carries an already-resolved event name and `core` renders it

     *
     *   - {@see SsePassthroughEvent::KEY} present (opt-in passthrough mode) →
     *     emit `event: <value>` for a value in the closed graphql-sse
     *     vocabulary and STRIP the key so the body renders bare; an
     *     out-of-vocabulary value is dropped (no `event:` line, key stripped).
     *     This is the ONLY path that produces an `event:` line without an
     *     in-body discriminator. No existing frame sets this key, so all
     *     pre-existing behaviour below is byte-identical (the key is absent and
     *     this branch is skipped).
     *   - `_type` absent → byte-identical to the pre-Phase-2 wire shape:
     *     the existing `event` field (if any, e.g. demo producer's
     *     `event: notification`) is honoured, and no other change is
     *     made.
     *   - `_type` present and on the {@see UiSseEventType} allow-list →
     *     emit `event: <_type>` (the canonical typed mapping overrides
     *     any client-supplied `event`; arbitrary strings MUST NOT escape
     *     the allow-list). The `_type` key remains in the JSON body so
     *     the wire envelope is self-describing.
     *   - `_type` present but unknown → log a warning, strip `_type`
     *     from the body, and fall back to default-message emission. We
     *     do not lose the payload; we only refuse to surface an
     *     unauthorised event name (matches the existing CR/LF-strip
     *     defensive normalise pattern).
     *
     * CR/LF injection on the `event:` line is prevented twice — first by
     * the allow-list (typed `_type` only emits values from a closed
     * enum), then by the `str_replace` on the rendered `event` line.
