/**
 * The door a `deferred_request_id` has to come through before its blocks stream.
 *
 * A deferred request is minted during the page render and redeemed moments later
 * over SSE. Two things have to be true for that to be safe: the redeemer must
 * hold the bind token the render issued, and the request must still be in the
 * registry. Either check failing ends the exchange politely with a terminal frame
 * rather than an error, because the usual cause is a stale tab or a double
 * redeem, not an attack.
 *
 * Note that {@see DeferredRequestRegistry::consume()} does not live up to its
 * name: it deletes the row only when the TTL has passed and otherwise returns the
 * entry where it is. Redemption is therefore bounded by that TTL, not by a single
 * use — which is why the door reads the registry twice rather than holding a
 * result it believes nobody else can obtain.
 *
 * Every failure path emits the same terminal frame: done, not live, close, do
 * not reconnect. Saying so in one place matters — the client's `close` listener
 * only fires deterministically if every abandonment looks identical, and this
 * literal was previously written out four separate times.
 *
 * Extracted from AsyncResourceSseServer by ep-slay-sse-god-class-2
 * (tk-sse2-deferred-door), which also collapsed the coroutine and non-coroutine
 * paths: they were the same body twice, differing only in a cancellation check
 * and whether the failure log carried a stack trace.

     * already failed the bind-token check or found no entry, and neither outcome

     * that is absent only becomes more absent once its TTL passes. Retrying would
